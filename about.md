### Development Team

Kevin Brosnan is a passionate developer of statistical techniques to address real life problems. He completed a B.Sc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Limerick, with a major in Statistics in August 2014. Kevin is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Limerick with a thesis titled "Statistical Modelling with Application to Flow Cytometry & Sports Science". Flow Cytometry is used across industries such as medical diagnostics and dairy sciences, however the current statistical methods do not compliment the technology used. Developing these improved statistical methods is the aim of the research. The fair and impartial refereeing of elite athletics is the research area of sports science which Kevin is currently working on. Kevin also has vast industry experience in Management Consultancy (Accenture), Banking (AIB) and developing analytic tools for multinational companies (Accenture).

Dr. Peter Fennell completed his PhD under the supervision of Prof. James Gleeson in the department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Limerick. Funded through a Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) scholarship he was a member of Prof. Gleeson's Stochastic Dynamics and Complex Systems group, as well as the <a href="http://www.macsi.ul.ie" target = "_blank_">MACSI</a> group which is embedded in the dept. of Mathematics and Statistics. Peter's research focuses on stochastic processes (both Markovian and non-Markovian) on complex networks, utilising both mathematical and statistical techniques. To date, his work has resulted in three journal publications, and has been presented at six leading international conferences in Europe and the United States. In addition, as an active member of MACSI, Dr. Fennell has been involved in a number of collaborative projects with various different companies, both as a team player and as a project leader. In each of these projects, mathematical and statistical methods were used to understand data relating to an industrial problem, and subsequently to construct highly effective tools that were implemented in the companies infrastructure.
